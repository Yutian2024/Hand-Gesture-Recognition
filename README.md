# Hand Gesture Recognition
This repository contains a CNN-based hand gesture recognition system.  
It classifies images into predefined gesture categories using deep learning.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment gesture images.
- **CNN Architecture**: Lightweight convolutional network for fast training and inference.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Supports multiple gesture categories.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss curves.

## Requirements
The notebook was written on Google Colab. To run it, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn
- jupyter
